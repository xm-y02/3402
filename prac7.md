Week7:
===
Learning Activities & Resources
===
Learn more about php in this week's study and test and use this part of php in this week's assignment. I learnt the big boxes and content of PHP writing through PP in class. This includes the use of some algorithms and symbols. But in addition to that, 
I looked up some related content to help me learn more. Like youtube.

I also encountered some problems in my assignments, like after I wrote the php code but could not display it in the web page. Then I checked and found out that it was a mistake in the path, and in turn I iterated the code and tried it to see if it could be displayed in the web page.
Also I used echo,decision statements,functions etc. Finally I completed the task of displaying and writing.

Estimated Hours
===
I spent three days learning what PHP is all about, and two days writing and modifying and looking for problems.

Future
===
I think that php learning has helped me a lot, through this problem and learning, it makes me interested in video teaching and motivated to design the webpage, I hope that next time I can finish the new content faster and have a better manifestation.
