Learning Activities & Resources
===
Continuing to learn about PHP this week and how to make web pages. And work with a group to develop Open House web pages during the week.I have applied this theory to the chunking method of learning, which reduces cognitive load and increases learning efficiency.
The first step is to complete the basic structural coding of the web page using basic php syntax. Then implement the display of the content, my part is to do the About us. e.g. About us about james cook university, quality of teaching, courses offered, employment rate graduation rate etc.. The goal was to create an informative and engaging "About Us" page for the James Cook University Open House website that effectively communicates the institution's values, history and unique selling points to prospective students and visitors.
Concise course content of next important milestones and achievements. Visual elements such as photos enhance user engagement.The code data of the website is then transferred to a github created by the group, so that it can be easily viewed and modified by members of the group for the remainder of the content. Finally the group performs code review and testing to optimise performance and user experience.

Estimated Hours

I spent six days learning and working on the web code and uploading the code to communicate with the group members to complete the open house page.

learning Insights
==
I learnt a specific module of PHP programming every day in these days and applied it to the Open House project on the same day, so as to verify the learning effect to prove that my learning theory is reliable, through this experiment, I deeply experienced the effect of chunked learning method. Learning deeply in a short period of time and immediately applying the knowledge to practice not only deepens the memory of knowledge points, but also improves the ability to solve practical problems.
