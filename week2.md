Learning Activities & Resources

I learnt and used html,css to create a simple web page.<br>
### Estimated Hours

<br> Firstly I started by thinking about the layout of the page, looking through some websites to get some ideas and eventually settled on making a cafe website, this took about an hour. <br>
Content Insights
Secondly I started writing the html first to frame the first page and was filling in the content. Then in the process of writing css to modify the page, in this process I encountered some difficulties, such as the navigation bar of the page can not be centred and no spacing,
so I looked up some information and videos on the Internet, and repeatedly check the code to finally solve this problem, which cost me half a day.<br>

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

The next day I started working on the second and third pages, which made me a lot faster, I added images and code for jumping pages for the main page, and touched up the text and background to make the page look more like a cafe page.<br>
In the process, I also followed some tutorials to learn about other features of css. However, I think some of the videos with code instructions were more effective than the text-based resources in getting me more engaged and quality in my coding, so I'll be looking for more videos like that.<br>
