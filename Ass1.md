This is video instruction that has helped me a lot in learning to build web pages.
Secondly I made another website with joomla, I checked some videos and information on youtube and google about how to use joomla to build a webpage, but in the process of doing it, I still can't do the same as the wordpress webpage, I have a lot of difficulty in adjusting the background of the page and setting the size of the image position, I think joomla is a bit difficult for me.

In the end, I chose weebly to build a website, through youtube, google to find relevant information, and create a wordpress and basically the same page.

After making these two websites and using wordpress and weebly as two kinds of cms, it helps me a lot to build websites in the future, which is good for making more difficult and designing webpages, and it also stimulates my interest in webpage making.
