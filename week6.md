Learning Activities & Resources
===
In this week's activity, our group created three links, slack,trello and github. a platform for communication and discussion within the group. After the creation of these links, we divided the work among the group members.
In trello, each person is assigned a task and a part of the project that each person is good at, which helps the group to collaborate and complete the task better.
And slack is a platform that facilitates communication and discussion among group members. When group members share or raise problems, they can discuss and solve them faster.
Finally github,pulling requests and links in here makes it easier to view the contents of the task file, which can be uploaded and modified by members of the group.
